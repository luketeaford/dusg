# TODO

- [ ] The build should allow `path` and `inputPath` to be configurable.
- [ ] The documentation needs to be updated to explain what `path` and `inputPath` are.
- [ ] The test descriptions should be improved to give a better idea of the documentation.
- [ ] The CLI should have a few separate tests since it's also the public API.
